These arguments to SARIMAX model are called order `(p,d,q)` and seasonal order `(P,D,Q,s)` respectively and hence 7 parameters to tune. Prior to model training, you need to set up these parameters which are defined in the following.\n","\n","#### Order Parameters `(p, d, q)`:\n","- `p`: The order of the autoregressive (AR) component, indicating how many past observations are considered. It is also known as the AR order.\n","- `d`: The degree of differencing required to make the time series stationary. It is also known as the differencing order.\n","- `q`: The order of the moving average (MA) component, indicating how many past white noise error terms are considered.

Typically, `p` should be a non-negative integer. Common values for `p` are usually in the range of 0 to 3, although higher values are possible depending on the specific characteristics of the data. A higher p indicates a longer memory of past values in the model.\n","\n"," The moving average order `q` represents the number of past white noise error terms that are used to predict the current value. Similar to `p`, `q` should also be a non-negative integer. Common values for `q` are typically in the range of 0 to 3, but higher values may be necessary for certain time series. A higher `q` indicates a stronger reliance on past error terms to make predictions.\n","\n"," The differencing order `d` represents the number of times the time series needs to be differenced to achieve stationarity. `d` should be a non-negative integer. Common values for `d` are usually in the range of 0 to 2. A `d` value of 0 means the time series is already stationary, while higher values indicate the number of differencing operations required to make it stationary.\n"],"metadata":{"nteract":{"transient":{"deleting":false}}},"id":"0451e60b-3530-40fe-8453-1ab7672ca72a"},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["#### Determine Optional Parameters:\n","- The `enforce_stationarity` parameter controls whether or not the model should enforce stationarity on the time series data before fitting the SARIMAX model. When `enforce_stationarity` is set to `True` (the default), it indicates that the SARIMAX model should enforce stationarity on the time series data. This means that the SARIMAX model will automatically apply differencing to the data to make it stationary, as specified by the `d` and `D` orders, before fitting the model. This is a common practice because many time series models, including SARIMAX, assume that the data is stationary. If your time series is non-stationary (e.g., it exhibits trends or seasonality), it is generally a good practice to set `enforce_stationarity` to `True` and let the SARIMAX model handle the differencing to achieve stationarity. If your time series is already stationary (e.g., it has no trends or seasonality), you can set `enforce_stationarity` to `False` to avoid unnecessary differencing.\n","\n","- The `enforce_invertibility` parameter controls whether or not the model should enforce invertibility on the estimated parameters during the optimization process. When `enforce_invertibility` is set to `True` (the default), it indicates that the SARIMAX model should enforce invertibility on the estimated parameters. Invertibility ensures that the model is well-defined and that the estimated autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) coefficients are within the range of stationarity. Enforcing invertibility is typically recommended to ensure that the SARIMAX model adheres to the theoretical requirements for a stable time series model and helps prevent issues with model estimation and stability.\n","\n","- The default is an `AR(1)` model which refers to `(1,0,0)`. However, keep in mind that the appropriate values for `p`, `q`, and `d` can vary from one time series to another, and determining the optimal values often involves analyzing the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF and PACF) of the time series data and using model selection criteria like AIC or BIC. It's common practice to try different combinations of p, q, and d and evaluate the model's performance for a given dataset. Note that the parameters for the seasonal order `(P, D, Q, s)` is similar in concept to the non-seasonal order parameters `(p, q, d)`, hence it is avoided explaining in detail again.
