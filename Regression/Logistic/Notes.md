Step 1: Import the data
Step 2: Clean the data
Step 3: Vizualize the data. A early analysis. In this case, we can look at the relationship between type and color.
Step 4: Encode the data. Encoding enables us to turn categorical data into numerical data, without losing any information. There are Features and Labels.

Summary
Features: Input variables used by the model to make predictions.
Labels: Output variables that the model aims to predict.

Features are the input variables or attributes used to make predictions. They are the measurable properties or characteristics of the phenomena being observed. In a dataset, features are the independent variables that help in predicting the outcome.

Example in Tabular Data: If you have a dataset about houses, the features might include the number of bedrooms, square footage, location, age of the house, and so on.
