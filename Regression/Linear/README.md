# Linear Regression Project

This project explores linear regression techniques to predict continuous values, such as pumpkin prices.

## Objectives
1. Understand the relationship between features and target variables.
2. Build and evaluate linear regression models.
3. Visualize regression lines and residuals.

## Key Files
- **Notes.md**: Contains detailed explanations of linear regression concepts and visualizations.
- **Pumpkin_Price_Prediction.py**: Implements a linear regression model to predict pumpkin prices.

## Tools and Libraries
- Scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing regression results.
