# Classification Project

This project focuses on building classification models to categorize data into predefined classes. The primary dataset used is the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of flower species.

## Objectives
1. Build and evaluate classification models.
2. Visualize feature importance and decision boundaries.
3. Compare different algorithms (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forests).

## Key Files
- **Classification_2.py**: Implements a classification pipeline for the Iris dataset.
- **Flower Classification Project/Classification_Version2.py**: Focuses on feature importance and predictions for flower classification.

## Tools and Libraries
- Scikit-learn: For model training and evaluation.
- Matplotlib: For visualizing feature importance and decision trees.
